        I'm so sad.
        <br/><br/>
        My backpack is ripped, so my mom says I have to get a new one... <br/><br/>

        My backpack was the best. I took it on a drive from California to Texas, from Texas to Mississippi. In the
        United States it's been to California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, New
        York, Philadelphia, Massachusetts, and Missouri. I've also taken it to Canada, London, Pakistan, Turkey, and
        Greece... I'm going to miss it...
        <br/><br/>
        I told one of my friends this (who went on many trips with me in Mississippi and Philidelphia) and she said:
        <br/>
        "Oh Umer's backpack<br/>
        We knew ye well<br/>
        You engulfed all of Umer's stuff<br/>
        And some of mine too haha<br/>
        And never failed to reproduce it<br/>
        Take care, dear backpack<br/>
        You may be ripped<br/>
        But you'll be intact in our hearts<br/>
        *subtle sobs*" <br/><br/><br/>

        May my backpack Rip In Pieces. May it RIP...
