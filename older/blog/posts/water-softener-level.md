- Just got this in my YouTube suggestions. I've been meaning to document my version of this I made 2ish years ago, which is an ESP8266 (with WiFi) that is taped to the lid of the salt tank, plugged into a wall outlet. I used an IR sensor rather than ultrasonic, and the thin wires just go under the lid. The 8266 is running ESPHome so HA is able to find it on its own.
