| [Poetry Memorizer](poetrymemorizer)                      | Either search [poetryoutloud.org](https://poetryoutloud.org) database or paste your own poem to have it separated so that you can copy the lines to learn them. -- I made this because my highschool required memorizing and reciting poems. I don't think this actually helped me learn the poems but an attempt was made. | 10/24/2015        |
